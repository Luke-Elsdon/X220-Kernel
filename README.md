# X220-Kernel

Tested on Gentoo's 4.9.76 Kernel.

Recently moved over to Gentoo and I struggled to find an up to date kernel for the Thinkpad X220 so I have posted mine up for anyone who doesn't want to use genkernel.

This kernel is for my specific use-case so:
- Note that by default there is only support for ext4
- Note that everything is built in and no module support is enabled.

I have yet to test bluetooth but have had no issues with anything else so far, if anyone has suggestions on slimming this down further or any issues let me know.
